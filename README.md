# Web Programming

Practices developed in the course Web Programming.

The first one was the implementation (with only HTML5 and CSS3) of a book recomendation site.

The second one added funcionality to this site (only PHP), creating a database (MySQL) with books and users and managing it, also managing user's sessions.

The files and the database were hosted in one server the university provided.

Both have documentation but it is only available in Spanish.
