# Web Programming

Practices developed in the course Web Programming.

The first one was the implementation (with only HTML5 and CSS3) of a book recomendation site.

The second one added funcionality to this site (only PHP), creating a database with books and users and managing them, also managing user's sessions.

Both have documentation but it is only available in Spanish.
